    <h2>Why We Built This Toolkit</h2>
    
    <p>
        We created this toolkit because we know firsthand how overwhelming it can feel to navigate the endless stream of information out there. Platform Engineering is a fast-moving field, and while there’s no shortage of technical resources (which are, of course, essential), we noticed a gap: there isn’t much guidance on everything around the technology—the practices, approaches, and ways of working that help turn Platform Engineering into a true discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
        That’s where this toolkit comes in. Inside, you’ll find a curated mix of proven practices, frameworks, and references—some we’ve borrowed from others, some we’ve developed ourselves, all tried and tested in real-world use. To make it easier to explore, we’ve taken care to organize and categorize the material so you can quickly find what’s relevant, no matter where you are in your Platform Engineering journey.
    </p>

    <h3>A few important things to highlight:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Not just for Platform Engineering.</strong> Many of the practices here come from other disciplines. We’ve included them because they can be just as valuable for platform work.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a library, but a guide.</strong> Rather than simply collecting links and frameworks, this toolkit offers an organized view to help you make sense of the landscape and apply what’s most useful.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Most importantly, this project comes from a place of care. We’ve put it together in our own spare time because we believe in sharing with the wider community. If it helps you navigate this space with a bit more clarity and confidence, then it’s done its job.

                                        Tom helps organizations optimize software delivery through Agile, DevOps and Platform Engineering. He started developing web pages when he first touched a computer in the 90's. With background in mathematics and computer science, his development carreer changed quickly when he realized most impact is made by having effective teams. Since then, he's been helping teams and organizations get the most out of themselves: from designing new organizational setups, to maturity models, leading teams, and team coaching.
                                        At ASML IT, he drives organizational change with a focus on Team Topologies and Platform Engineering.
