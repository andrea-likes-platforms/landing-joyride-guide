  <h2>Platform Engineering: A Friendly Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Engineering for platforms has existed for decades. What has evolved is <strong>what</strong> is engineered, <strong>how</strong>, and <strong>for what purpose</strong>. Advances in technology, new practices, and growing complexity have reshaped the discipline. The drive to optimise and automate remains constant, but the reasons behind it and the mechanisms used have changed significantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think of a <strong>theme park</strong>: a network of rides, shows, and services, all interdependent. For visitors to have a seamless experience, everything must work reliably, safely, and in coordination. Behind the scenes sits a layered, complex system ensuring this happens.
  </p>
  <p>
    Organisations and their platforms operate in the same way. A platform is not just technology — it is a system of people, processes, and tools working together to deliver value through services. Platforms usually exist at different levels of abstraction — from infrastructure foundations to developer enablement — and often share critical dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rooted in DevOps principles, <strong>Platform Engineering</strong> provides a structured approach to reduce complexity, embed automation, standardise what can be standardised, and minimise errors. Its objective is clear: accelerate delivery and improve consistency. Done well, it enables cohesiveness, scalability, speed, and effective governance across the organisation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Returning to the theme park analogy: Platform Engineering allows each “ride” or product team to focus on its unique experience while relying on standardised, on-demand, self-service, and reliable components.
  </p>
  <p>
    These services are typically provided through an <strong>Internal Developer Platform (IDP)</strong>. While the name suggests developers, consumers are not always developers, nor do they always see themselves as such. The way services are consumed follows the familiar <strong>X-as-a-Service (XaaS)</strong> model, rooted in service provision and ease of access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continue exploring the toolkit, share it if it resonates with you, and contribute where you can — then apply what fits in your context.
  </p>

  <h2>What Does Platform Engineering Need?</h2>
  <p>
    Technology and tooling are important, but success depends just as much — if not more — on capabilities and ways of working. At a high level, it relies on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clear vision and objectives</strong> to guide the platform’s purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>Investment</strong> in both people and technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering expertise</strong> to support modern practices.</li>
    <li><strong>A product mindset</strong> so the platform continually evolves as a product.</li>
    <li><strong>A service mindset</strong> so platform services are reliable and well-managed.</li>
    <li><strong>Adoption focus</strong>, ensuring the people who use the platform can succeed with it.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform teams</strong> with the right structure, flow-oriented ways of working, and mindset.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To assess these capabilities, explore the <strong>Platform Engineering Maturity Models</strong> under the <em>Starting &amp; Progressing</em> section of this site.
