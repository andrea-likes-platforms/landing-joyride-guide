  <h2>Platform Engineering: A Friendly Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Think of a <strong>Theme Park</strong> — full of rides, attractions, and services, all interconnected and dependent on one another. For the park to thrive, everything must run smoothly: rides need to be safe and reliable, staff coordinated, the experience seamless, and the whole environment kept secure, up to date, and compliant. Behind the scenes, it’s a complex, layered system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Organisations are no different. Regardless of industry, size, or domain, they are also complex ecosystems. Their success depends on <strong>platforms</strong>: the shared foundations that curate and deliver common capabilities. Just as rides in a theme park rely on standard infrastructure and services, platforms provide technology teams with reusable building blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each platform is a system of people, processes, and technology working together to deliver value through services. Platforms can exist at different levels of abstraction — from infrastructure to developer enablement — and often share dependencies. <strong>Platform Engineering</strong> is the discipline that makes these capabilities reliable and consumable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rooted in DevOps principles, Platform Engineering focuses on reducing complexity, standardising what can be standardised, and minimising errors — all to accelerate delivery and improve consistency. It is a key ingredient in enabling <strong>cohesiveness, scalability, speed, and governance at scale</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Returning to the theme park analogy: Platform Engineering ensures each ride, show, or attraction can focus on its unique experience, while consuming standardised components <em>as a service</em> — available on demand, self-served, and reliable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mechanism through which these services are offered is often called an <strong>Internal Developer Platform (IDP)</strong>, and the way they are consumed follows the familiar <strong>“X-as-a-Service” (XaaS)</strong> model.
  </p>

  <h2>What Does Platform Engineering Need?</h2>
  <p>
    Technology and tooling are important, but success depends just as much — if not more — on capabilities and ways of working. At a high level, it relies on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clear vision and objectives</strong> to guide the platform’s purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>Investment</strong> in both people and technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering expertise</strong> to support modern practices.</li>
    <li><strong>A product mindset</strong> so the platform continually evolves as a product.</li>
    <li><strong>A service mindset</strong> so platform services are reliable and well-managed.</li>
    <li><strong>Adoption focus</strong>, ensuring the people who use the platform can succeed with it.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform teams</strong> with the right structure, flow-oriented ways of working, and mindset.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To assess these capabilities, explore the <strong>Platform Engineering Maturity Models</strong> under the <em>Starting &amp; Progressing</em> section of this site.
